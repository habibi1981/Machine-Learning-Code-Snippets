There is no best technique for dimensionality reduction and no mapping of techniques to problems. Instead, the best approach is to use systematic controlled experiments to discover what dimensionality reduction techniques, when paired with your model of choice, result in the best performance on your dataset. Typically, linear algebra and manifold learning methods assume that all input features have the same scale or distribution. This suggests that it is good practice to either normalize or standardize data prior to using these methods if the input variables have differing scales or units.
