The solution is to save the data preparation object to file along with the model. For example, it
is common to use the pickle framework (built-in to Python) for saving machine learning models
for later use, such as saving a final model. This same framework can be used to save the object
that was used for data preparation. Later, the model and the data preparation object can be
loaded and used.
It is convenient to save the entire objects to file, such as the model object and the data
preparation object. Nevertheless, experts may prefer to save just the model parameters to file,
then load them later and set them into a new model object. This approach can also be used
with the coefficients used for scaling the data, such as the min and max values for each variable,
or the mean and standard deviation for each variable.
The choice of which approach is appropriate for your project is up to you, but I recommend
saving the model and data preparation object (or objects) to file directly for later use. To make
the idea of saving the object and data transform object to file concrete, let's look at a worked
example.
